# Javascript Calculator
I made this calculator simply in Vanilla Javascript but **only** allows 2 digits (e.g 10 + 15) and not more than that, for example, 5 + 5 + 5. Please be aware of this.

## How to use the calculator
Because the Javascript Calculator is based on function and parameters, you would have to calculate in a specific format, for example, add(10, 5)). Here is the documentation list of how to use the Javascript Calculator. Remember the 'number' is just a number you need to put there:

| Addition | Subtraction | Division | Multiplication |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| add(number, number) | sub(number, number) | div(number, number) | div(number, number) |

Simply download the Javascript Calculator, launch it on a code editor and run it!
